# A Survey of Large Language Models Attribution [[ArXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03731)]

---

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

Open-domain dialogue systems, driven by large language models, have changed the way we use conversational AI. 
However, these systems often produce content that might not be reliable. In traditional open-domain settings, the focus is mostly on the answerâ€™s relevance or accuracy rather than evaluating whether the answer is attributed to the retrieved documents. A QA model with high accuracy may not necessarily achieve high attribution. 

Attribution refers to the capacity of a model, such as an LLM, to generate and provide evidence, often in the form of references or citations, that substantiates the claims or statements it produces. This evidence is derived from identifiable sources, ensuring that the claims can be logically inferred from a foundational corpus, making them comprehensible and verifiable by a general audience. The primary purposes of attribution include enabling users to validate the claims made by the model, promoting the generation of text that closely aligns with the cited sources to enhance accuracy and reduce misinformation or hallucination, and establishing a structured framework for evaluating the completeness and relevance of the supporting evidence in relation to the presented claims.


In this repository, we focus on unraveling the sources that these systems tap into for attribution or citation. We delve into the origins of these facts, their utilization by the models, the efficacy of these attribution methodologies, and grapple with challenges tied to ambiguous knowledge reservoirs, inherent biases, and the pitfalls of excessive attribution.

**âœ¨ Work in progress. We would like to appreciate any contributions via PRs, issues from NLP community.**

     <!-- ```
      This position paper says "For example, for question answering tasks our envisioned model is able to synthesize a singleanswer that incorporates information from many documents in the corpus, and it will be able to support assertions in the answer by referencing supporting evidence in the corpus, much like a properly crafted Wikipedia entry supports each assertion of fact with a link to a primary source. This is just one of many novel tasks that this type of model has the potential to enable."

      a. hallucination of attribution i.e. does attribution faithfully to its content?
      b. Inability to attribute parameter knowledge of model self.
      c. Validity of the knowledge source - source trustworthiness. Faithfulness â‰  Factuality
      d. Bias in attribution method
